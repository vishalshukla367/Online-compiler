Docker:- This is a great tool to launch almost any operating system within a 1 second like:- ubuntu, centos etc. This tool is used in deployment phase of software development. This tool is used when we want that any project that we built in our system also run on other system irrespective of the Operating syetem then we create on docker container and make project on the top of it then this project will run on all the system.
